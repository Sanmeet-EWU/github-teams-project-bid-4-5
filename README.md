## Choice of Projects:

### 1. Game (1st Preference):
   - **Description:** Not 100% set on the game idea yet but one suggestion we have right now is a 3 zone RPG that will have three class choices. The style will be like the old school SNES RPGs. It will also have random encounters, a small progression system, the 3 zones will not necessarily be where enemies spawn, lastly a short story. A scoreboard to compare to other players if there is an element to be tracked.

### 2. Hotel website with Task/Day Scheduler (2nd Preference):
   - **Description:** We were thinking of integrating a task schedule on a hotel booking website to have the option to plan the days.

### 3. Study Website (3rd Preference):
   - **Description:** Very similar to Kahoot/Quizlet, we want to make a website that can help people study. From group or individual quizzes with a small simple game to enhance retention of materials. Another option would be Flash cards with the ability to make a quiz from it, and match games are examples of what could go into it.

## Additional Remarks/Inputs:

Please tell us about any other factors that we should take into consideration (e.g., if you really would like to work on a project for some particularly convincing reason).

- **Game was our number one choice** as it provides a different kind of challenge as most of us donâ€™t have experience designing and making a game, so it would be cool to think through it.
